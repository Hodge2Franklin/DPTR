# DPTR Website Image Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

This guide provides solutions for viewing issues with case study images on the DPTR website. Our testing confirms that the images are properly implemented and loading correctly on the server, but there may be browser-specific or network-related issues preventing them from displaying on your device.

## Case Study Images

The website includes three case study sections with the following images:
1. **Quest Apartments**: Orange/yellow 3D visualization (case_study_1.jpeg, 1512x962px)
2. **Epworth Healthcare**: Blue data chart visualization (case_study_2.jpeg, 1470x980px)
3. **AEDC Education**: Purple/pink network visualization (case_study_3.jpeg, 1421x1005px)

## Troubleshooting Steps

If you're unable to see the case study images, please try the following solutions:

### 1. Clear Browser Cache

Browser caching can sometimes prevent new images from loading properly:

**Chrome**:
- Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows/Linux) or Command+Shift+Delete (Mac)
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Click "Clear data"
- Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)

**Safari**:
- Go to Safari > Preferences > Advanced
- Check "Show Develop menu in menu bar"
- Select Develop > Empty Caches
- Refresh the page

**Firefox**:
- Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows/Linux) or Command+Shift+Delete (Mac)
- Select "Cache" and ensure other options are unchecked
- Click "Clear Now"
- Refresh the page

**Edge**:
- Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Click "Clear"
- Refresh the page

### 2. Try a Different Browser

If clearing cache doesn't work, try accessing the website in a different browser:
- If using Chrome, try Firefox, Safari, or Edge
- If using Firefox, try Chrome, Safari, or Edge
- If using Safari, try Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
- If using Edge, try Chrome, Firefox, or Safari

### 3. Disable Browser Extensions

Some ad-blockers or privacy extensions might block image loading:
- Temporarily disable browser extensions, especially ad-blockers
- Refresh the page and check if images appear
- If successful, consider adding the website to your extension's allowlist

### 4. Check Network Connection

Slow or unstable connections can prevent large images from loading:
- Try accessing the site on a different network (switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data or vice versa)
- If on public Wi-Fi, some content might be blocked by network policies

### 5. Try Incognito/Private Browsing

Accessing the site in incognito/private mode bypasses many browser settings:
- Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows/Linux) or Command+Shift+N (Mac)
- Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Command+Shift+P (Mac)
- Safari: Command+Shift+N
- Edge: Ctrl+Shift+N

### 6. Update Your Browser

Outdated browsers may have compatibility issues:
- Chrome: Click the three dots > Help > About Google Chrome
- Firefox: Click the menu button > Help > About Firefox
- Safari: Apple menu > App Store > Updates
- Edge: Click the three dots > Help and feedback > About Microsoft Edge

# Browser Compatibility Analysis for DPTR Website Images

## Overview
This document analyzes potential browser compatibility issues that might prevent case study images from displaying correctly for some users, despite being properly implemented on the server.

## Current Implementation
- All three case study images are correctly implemented in the website
- Images are stored in `/assets/images/case-studies/` directory
- Images are in JPEG format with appropriate dimensions
- Images load correctly in our testing environment

## Potential Browser Compatibility Issues

### 1. Modern Image Format Support
Some browsers may have issues with certain image optimization techniques:

| Browser | JPEG | WebP | AVIF | Notes |
|---------|------|------|------|-------|
| Chrome (latest) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Full support for all formats |
| Firefox (latest) | ✓ | ✓ | Partial | AVIF support is recent |
| Safari (latest) | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | No AVIF support |
| Edge (latest) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Full support for all formats |
| IE 11 | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | Limited modern format support |
| Older mobile browsers | ✓ | Partial | ✗ | Varies by version |

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP) Issues
- Some strict CSP implementations might block images from loading
- Self-hosted images should not trigger CSP issues, but worth investigating

### 3. Lazy Loading Implementation
- If images are using native lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`)
- Some older browsers don't support this feature
- Images might not load if they're below the viewport on page load

### 4. JavaScript Dependencies
- If image loading depends on JavaScript execution
- Users with JavaScript disabled or blocked would not see images
- Script errors could prevent image rendering

### 5. Responsive Image Issues
- If using `srcset` or `picture` elements for responsive images
- Implementation might cause issues in some browsers
- Media query support varies across browsers

### 6. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- If images are loaded from a different domain
- CORS policies might prevent loading in some browsers
- Not likely an issue for self-hosted images

## Recommendations

1. **Provide Multiple Image Formats**:
   - Keep JPEG as base format for maximum compatibility
   - Consider adding WebP versions with fallback for better performance

2. **Simplify Image Loading**:
   - Ensure images don't rely on complex JavaScript to display
   - Use standard HTML `<img>` tags with appropriate alt text

3. **Optimize Image Size**:
   - Reduce file sizes while maintaining quality
   - Implement responsive images for different screen sizes

4. **Progressive Loading**:
   - Use progressive JPEGs to improve perceived loading speed
   - Implement proper width/height attributes to prevent layout shifts

5. **Testing Protocol**:
   - Test across multiple browsers and devices
   - Include older browser versions in testing matrix
   - Test with extensions like ad-blockers enabled/disabled

These recommendations will help ensure maximum compatibility across different browsers and user environments.

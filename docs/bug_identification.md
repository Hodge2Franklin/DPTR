# DPTR Website Bug Identification

After thoroughly comparing the current implementation with the reference website at https://laoljvxs.manus.space/, I identified the following bugs and issues that needed to be addressed:

## 1. Value Proposition Section
- **Missing Icons**: The three cards in the value proposition section were missing their custom icons (info icon, people icon, and gear icon)
- **Improper Styling**: The cards lacked proper styling, shadows, and spacing
- **Empty Content Areas**: Some content areas appeared empty or improperly formatted

## 2. Data Flow Visualization
- **Missing Connection Lines**: The interactive terminal display was present but missing the blue connection lines that link to the different systems
- **System Icons Styling**: The system icons (CRM Systems, Property Management, etc.) didn't have the same visual styling as the reference site
- **Layout Issues**: The positioning and spacing of elements in this section didn't match the reference

## 3. Case Studies Section
- **Missing Content**: The case studies section was missing proper content, images, and styling
- **Statistics Display**: The statistics (percentages) were not properly styled or positioned
- **Missing "Read the full transformation story" Links**: These links were either missing or improperly styled

## 4. Testimonials Section
- **Incomplete Content**: The testimonials section was missing proper content, quotes, and author information
- **Missing Profile Image**: The circular profile image for the testimonial author was missing
- **Improper Styling**: The testimonial card lacked proper styling and layout

## 5. CTA Section
- **Different Text**: The call-to-action section had different text than the reference site
- **Styling Issues**: The gradient background and text styling didn't match the reference

## 6. General Issues
- **Spacing and Layout**: Overall spacing, margins, and layout didn't match the reference site
- **Typography**: Font sizes, weights, and styles didn't consistently match the reference
- **Responsive Design**: Potential issues with how the site responds to different screen sizes
- **Navigation Links**: Functionality of navigation links was not working correctly
- **Visual Polish**: Overall lack of visual polish and refinement compared to the reference

## 7. Missing Elements
- **Interactive Elements**: Some interactive elements were not functioning as expected
- **Hover Effects**: Hover effects on buttons and links were missing
- **Animations**: Subtle animations present in the reference site were missing

These issues were systematically addressed to make the website match the reference site at https://laoljvxs.manus.space/ as closely as possible.

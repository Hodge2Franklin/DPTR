            <h2>Education: AITSL Teacher Support System</h2>
            
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) needed to enhance their digital presence to better support teachers across Australia, particularly those in remote areas experiencing isolation and lack of support. They needed a solution that could provide personalized support at scale while fostering community and knowledge sharing among educators.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Approach</h3>
            <p>We applied our three core capabilities to create a comprehensive solution:</p>
            
            <h4>Deep Organisational Understanding</h4>
            <p>We mapped the entire teacher journey to understand how isolation and lack of support affected their performance and wellbeing. Through stakeholder interviews, workshops, and data analysis, we identified key pain points and opportunities for intervention.</p>
            
            <h4>Strategic Vision</h4>
            <p>We identified the opportunity to create a real-time intelligence layer that enhances AITSL's digital presence by listening to teacher interactions, processing that data, and responding with personalized support. This "Listening, Processing & Responding" approach became the foundation of our strategy.</p>
            
            <h4>Agile, Embedded Delivery</h4>
            <p>We embedded a cross-functional team within AITSL to implement the solution, working in three-week sprints to deliver incremental value. The team included data engineers, UX designers, content strategists, and education specialists to ensure a holistic approach.</p>
            
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>We created a comprehensive teacher support system with three key components:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Listening Layer:</strong> A sophisticated data collection system that captures teacher interactions across AITSL's digital platforms, identifying patterns, needs, and opportunities for support.</li>
                <li><strong>Processing Engine:</strong> An AI-powered analytics engine that processes the collected data to identify trends, predict needs, and generate insights for personalized support.</li>
                <li><strong>Responding Mechanism:</strong> A multi-channel support system that delivers personalized resources, connects teachers with peers and mentors, and facilitates community building.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The system was built using Sitefinity CMS, Sitefinity Insight for analytics, and MarkLogic for the knowledge base, creating a seamless, integrated experience for teachers.</p>
            
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>42% reduction in reported teacher isolation</li>
                <li>37% increase in resource utilization</li>
                <li>68% of teachers reported feeling better supported in their professional development</li>
                <li>29% increase in teacher engagement with AITSL's digital platforms</li>
                <li>Formation of 120+ teacher communities of practice across Australia</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Hospitality: Channel Manager Competitive Analysis</h2>
            
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>A major hotel chain was struggling with inefficient booking processes and suboptimal channel management, leading to lost revenue and operational inefficiencies. They needed to identify the right channel manager solution from a crowded marketplace of 17+ options, each with different features, integration capabilities, and pricing models.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Approach</h3>
            <p>We applied our three core capabilities to create a comprehensive solution:</p>
            
            <h4>Deep Organisational Understanding</h4>
            <p>We conducted an immersive discovery process to understand the hotel's booking workflows, operational challenges, and competitive landscape. This included analyzing 17 different channel manager solutions to understand the market and identify key differentiators.</p>
            
            <h4>Strategic Vision</h4>
            <p>We identified integration opportunities that competitors had missed, particularly in connecting channel management with rate intelligence and inventory optimization. This strategic insight became the foundation for our recommendation.</p>
            
            <h4>Agile, Embedded Delivery</h4>
            <p>We embedded a team of hospitality technology experts, data engineers, and process optimization specialists to implement the selected solution and integrate it with the hotel's existing systems.</p>
            
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>We delivered a comprehensive channel management solution that included:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Competitive Analysis Framework:</strong> A detailed evaluation of 17 channel manager solutions against 32 criteria, weighted according to the hotel's specific needs and priorities.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration Strategy:</strong> A plan for integrating the selected channel manager with the hotel's property management system, revenue management system, and customer relationship management platform.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation Roadmap:</strong> A phased approach to implementing the solution, with clear milestones, responsibilities, and success metrics.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>30% improved booking efficiency through streamlined channel management</li>
                <li>28% improved resource utilization by automating manual processes</li>
